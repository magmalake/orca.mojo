# morca

Orchestration for data pipelines written in Mojo: DAGs declared in Mojo and
checked by the compiler, schedules in cron syntax, and a web UI for runs,
reruns and backfills. Steps run on [dista](https://github.com/morca-dev/dista)
clusters over Iceberg tables in object storage.

Early days: steps and pipelines are declared and checked at compile time, and
runs are recorded in Postgres and resume where they stopped, with Iceberg
reads pinned and commits recognised on retry (`morca.tables`), including
data files a step's dista tasks wrote (`append_files`), and steps that
replace their partitions so a rerun doesn't duplicate rows (`replaces=`).
A scheduler
fires cron schedules and backfills, and runs sensor pipelines when a dataset
they read gets a snapshot; `morca ui` shows pipelines, runs, logs and the
lineage of datasets, and starts, resumes, reruns, backfills, cancels and
rebuilds through it.
## Install

morca is the mojoshelf tin `morca-mojo`, built for Mojo 1.2:

```sh
pixi init lake && cd lake
pixi shelf add morca-mojo
```

A pipeline is a Mojo file ending in `morca_main[YourPipeline]()` (see
`examples/`), and the `morca` command (scheduler, UI, registration) is two
lines of your own (not in a file named `morca`, which would be the
module `morca` itself):

```mojo
# bin/scheduler.mojo
from morca.command import morca_command

def main() raises:
    morca_command()
```

```sh
mojo build pipelines/daily.mojo -o build/daily
mojo build bin/scheduler.mojo -o build/morca
./build/morca locate build/daily --root . && ./build/morca register ./build/daily
```

## Public API

A pipeline imports from `morca` (steps, pipelines, `Ctx`, partitions,
schedules, `morca_main`, `outdated()`), `morca.tables` (Iceberg reads and
commits from a step) and `morca.keyed` (`Keyed` partitions); a project's
`morca` and `morca_maintain` binaries import `morca.command` and
`morca.maintain`. Those modules are the public API, listed in
[`src/morca/__init__.mojo`](src/morca/__init__.mojo): a breaking change to
them comes with a note in the changelog. Everything under `morca._internal`
(the scheduler, stores, runners, UI) is internal and changes without one.

## morca.toml: how each pipeline runs

What a pipeline does stays in its code; where and how much it runs with
goes in `morca.toml` at the root of the project, which `morca register` and
`morca aws register` read (`morca._internal.config`):

```toml
[defaults]
placement = "ec2"
head_type = "t4g.medium"

[pipelines.gharchive]
worker_type = "c7g.xlarge"
workers = "0..4"             # or a fixed count, 4
worker_procs = 1             # or "auto"
max_runs = 2                 # over the code's Pipeline max_runs
env = { DISTA_WORKER_SLOTS = "4", GHARCHIVE_PARALLEL = "16" }
secrets = { GITHUB_TOKEN = "orca/github-token" }   # Secrets Manager IDs, never values
fills = "all"                # fill the whole range by itself (below)
fill_max_runs = 2            # fill runs at once, beside max_runs
fill_budget_per_day = 5.0    # estimated US dollars a UTC day
fill_window = "22..6"        # UTC hours fill runs start in
```

A pipeline the file names is registered with exactly what `[defaults]`,
its own table and any flags say (flags win, and are recorded as
overrides; a key taken out of the file goes back to its default). One it
doesn't name is registered as before. Its `env` goes to its runs alone, on
every runner, and is part of the EC2 warm pool's key; `MORCA_RUN_ENV` still
copies the scheduler's variables to every run, under the pipeline's own.
The registration keeps the file's SHA-256 and git commit. `--config F`
reads another file, `--no-config` none; `morca config show` prints each
value with its source (code default, morca.toml, flag, environment). Every key, the
precedence and migrating from flags: [docs/morca-toml.md](docs/morca-toml.md).

**Fills.** With `fills = "all"` the scheduler fills the pipeline's whole
range by itself, from its first partition through the last one that has
ended. The default is `"since_registration"`, where a schedule fills from
registration on. Each fill run takes one partition, trigger `fill`, in
`fill_order` (`oldest` or `newest`). A fill never runs a done partition
again; that stays `morca backfill --rerun`. It waits for the pipeline's
queued runs, starts at most `fill_max_runs` runs on top of `max_runs`, and
only in `fill_window`. It stops when the pipeline is paused, by a person or
by the watchdog.

The budget is an estimate from morca.fleet's on-demand price table, and it
fails closed: fill runs on EC2 or Kubernetes don't start without a budget,
nor when a price is unknown. The pipeline page's Fill line and
`/api/pipelines/<name>` show done of total, rate, ETA, today's spend
against the budget, and why the fill is idle. Keyed pipelines and sensors
don't fill. See [Fills](docs/morca-toml.md#fills).

**Operations go through the UI or the remote CLI** (`morca login`, `morca
--remote <url> backfill|pause|unpause|cancel|resume`), which keep audit
rows. Change a fill's limits in `morca.toml` and register again. On AWS,
SSM `sudo docker exec scheduler morca ...` is for debugging only.

## Remote workers

A pipeline placed `worker:<pool>` runs on another machine, such as a coding
machine with spare CPU: `morca worker --pool <pool> --remote <url>` polls
`morca ui` for the pool's runs and runs them there, with its run's state
calls going over HTTPS to the UI (`morca._internal.http_store`), which writes them to
Postgres. Nothing on the worker holds database credentials. Its token,
from `morca worker-token create --pool <pool>`, is scoped to the pool and
revocable. A worker that dies has its runs requeued once their heartbeats
are stale, and a worker of another image than the pipeline's is given
nothing. Ops > Pools lists the workers' machines. See
[docs/workers.md](docs/workers.md).

## Alerts

Problems otherwise show only in the UI. With `MORCA_NOTIFY_URL` set to an
[ntfy](https://ntfy.sh) topic URL, the scheduler pushes them to the phone
app: a watchdog trip, a run that failed after its last retry, a stalled
fill, the control host's disk over 85%, a lost worker, and, from a script,
`morca notify --kind backup-failed ... "message"`. The same alert is sent at
most once per 30 minutes, and a failed send is retried later without
blocking the scheduler. `morca notify test` checks the setup; Ops > Control
shows what was sent. Every setting: [docs/alerts.md](docs/alerts.md).

## The watchdog

Every minute the scheduler checks launches, estimated cost, idle workers,
failing attempts, stuck runs and the control host's memory and disk. A rule
past a threshold pauses its pipelines and shows a banner; it never resumes
anything. Unpause the pipelines to clear the trip, `morca watchdog ack` to
keep them paused, or `morca watchdog snooze <rule> 2h` while you fix the
cause. On the `local` runner the cost rule reads "fixed price". Each rule's
thresholds and variables: [docs/watchdog.md](docs/watchdog.md).

## Running it on one server

[docs/hetzner.md](docs/hetzner.md) is the runbook for a fixed-price setup: one
Hetzner Cloud ARM server, the `local` runner, S3-compatible Object Storage
(`AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3`), secrets from files (`MORCA_SECRET_FETCH`), and
Cloudflare Tunnel, with scripts in `deploy/hetzner/`. On the `local` runner
the watchdog's cost rule reads "fixed price" and Ops > Pools says no
instances are launched.

## Releasing and operations

Releasing and operations: https://mlake.dev/getting-started/maintain

## Developing locally

The tests and examples above run from a checkout of this repository, with the
repositories it compiles from next to it (`../dista.mojo` and `../k8s.mojo`
for `pixi run toy` and the default tests, many more for `-e data`), at the
commits `.github/workflows/ci.yml` pins. [Develop
locally](https://mlake.dev/getting-started/develop) has the whole layout, a
loop that clones it from the workflow, the examples, a local Postgres,
scheduler and UI, the test suites and their timings, and how to try a change
inside [mojo-census](https://github.com/morca-dev/census) before it is
released. `pixi run -e default test` is the whole default suite (`pixi run
test` stops with "the task 'build-shared' is ambiguous"), about 12 minutes.

## Reruns that replace a partition

A new run of a key (`morca backfill --rerun`, `morca rerun`, the UI's rerun)
appends again to what its steps append to, beside the rows earlier runs
committed. A step that recomputes a key's rows declares the dataset in
`replaces=` instead of `writes=`:

```mojo
comptime LoadDay = Step[
    "load_day", Day, Int64, load_day, Mapped, replaces=["gharchive.events"],
]
```

Its `append` and `append_files` to that dataset then make the run's first
commit to each partition an `overwrite` that removes the files earlier
runs left there; its later commits append, and a retried attempt still
finds what it committed. Two runs replacing one partition at once don't
both keep their rows: the one that finds the other's files after its own
first commit fails instead of committing. `replace_partitions` and
`replace_partition_files` do the same per call. A rerun of done keys of a
pipeline whose steps append is refused unless `--allow-append` (in the UI,
a confirm button). See `morca.tables` and DESIGN.md.

Switching a step from `writes=` to `replaces=` keeps the pipeline's
registry hash, and so its done keys, as long as the datasets keep their
order.

## When a step's outputs must be made again

The registry hash covers a pipeline's step names, functions, edges and
declared datasets, not what a step's body does. When a change to the code
means its earlier outputs are wrong, raise the step's `version=` (an
integer; none is 0):

```mojo
comptime Refresh = Step["refresh", Day, Int64, refresh, Mapped, replaces=["mojo.repo_stats"], version=2]
```

The new version is a new hash. Once it's registered, the keys done under
the old one are no longer done: coverage counts again from zero, a keyed
sensor queues every key at its next snapshot, and `morca backfill <pipeline>
@all` queues them all. A time-partitioned pipeline with `fills = "all"`
fills its partitions again, within its fill limits (`fill_max_runs`,
`fill_window`, `fill_budget_per_day`), since its fill counts a partition
done only under code with the same steps' versions; any other change of
code fills nothing again. With `since_registration`, regenerate its history
with `morca backfill <pipeline> <range>` or `morca rebuild <dataset> <range>`
(which also reruns what reads it). `morca register` says which applies.

## Long runs across deploys

A run may last as long as it needs: a deploy doesn't wait for it, and
morca never stops it for one. With overlapping schedulers the old
scheduler keeps the run going under the old image while the new one
starts everything else. The run can tell that a newer version leads and
decide for itself when to end, between units of work. By default it
ignores it:

```mojo
from morca import Ctx, Name, outdated, outdated_why

def follow(mut ctx: Ctx, key: Name) raises -> Int:
    var polls = 0
    while not outdated():     # cheap: the heartbeat keeps the answer
        poll_once(key)        # one unit of work, saved before the next
        polls += 1
    ctx.log(String("handing over: ", outdated_why()))
    return polls
```

`outdated()` turns true once the pipeline is registered with other code
(another commit, or registry hash) or the run's scheduler drains;
`code_version()` and `desired_code_version()` say which versions. The
run's page, its JSON and `morca status <pipeline>` mark it outdated. See
[docs/overlap.md](docs/overlap.md#outdated-runs).
