# `mojo build`, reusing the binary of an identical earlier build.
#
# Many tests build the same binaries: tests/*.sh built build/morca about 20
# times and build/toy 15 times in one `pixi run test`, each a full compile.
# This keys a build on everything it can read and keeps each result under
# build/.mojo-build/, so a second build with the same key is a copy:
#
# - the arguments but -o's (sources, -I, -D and the rest), the
#   environment's path (a binary's rpath names it) and its packages (the
#   file names in $CONDA_PREFIX/conda-meta name each one's version and
#   build);
# - the name and contents of every .mojo, .mojoc and .mojopkg file under the
#   -I directories and under each source's directory, .git, .pixi and build
#   left out;
# - the CPU: mojo compiles for the host's, so a binary built on one runner
#   can die with "Illegal instruction" on another (GitHub's runners differ).
#   On Linux its model name and feature flags, on macOS its brand string.
#   MOJO_TARGET_CPU (e.g. x86-64-v3) builds for that CPU instead, with
#   --target-cpu, and the key names it rather than the host's: CI sets it
#   so a binary built on one of GitHub's runners serves the others.
#
# A build that fails keeps nothing. Entries unused for two days are removed;
# rm -rf build/.mojo-build clears them all. MOJO_BUILD_CACHE=0 always builds.
# MOJO_BUILD_CACHE_DIR keeps them elsewhere: CI's self-hosted runners keep
# them outside the checkout, where a fresh checkout can't remove them. Entries are written to a
# temporary file and renamed, so builds running at once never see half of
# one, and a hit removed under a build (by another's pruning) is built again.
