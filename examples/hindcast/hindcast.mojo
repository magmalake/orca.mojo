"""Hindcast: how good were NOAA's GFS forecasts of 2 m temperature? A daily
pipeline whose first step is a Rust worker (src/lib.rs, through
`morca.rust_step`) and whose second scores the forecasts in Mojo
(skill.mojo). examples/hindcast/README.md has the whole story.

Partitions are forecast cycles, the 00z run of each day.

1. **`forecasts`** (mapped, Rust): the cycle's 2 m temperature at leads 0 to
   7 days, fetched by Range requests from NOAA's bucket and decoded, into
   `hindcast.t2m` (65,160 rows a lead), partitioned by cycle and lead. It
   replaces the cycle's partitions, so a rerun leaves one copy.
2. **`skill`** (gather, Mojo): scores every forecast this run's data can
   now be scored against. A forecast of cycle C at lead L is valid at
   V = C + L, and its analysis is the f000 of cycle V. So a cycle's
   analysis scores the forecasts *valid that day* (C = V - 1 ... V - 7),
   and a cycle's forecasts can be scored for each V already fetched. The
   step recomputes each such V whole from what's in `hindcast.t2m` and
   replaces its partition in `hindcast.skill` and `hindcast.cities`.

That makes the result independent of the order cycles arrive in: daily
runs, a backfill in any order, or a rerun all end with every (C, L) whose
two cycles are fetched. A cycle's scorecard fills in as its next seven days
are fetched, and is complete once it has all seven leads: `hindcast report`
says which are.

    hindcast report [cycle]   skill per lead, the cycles still waiting for
                              analyses, and the city scorecard of `cycle`

What the tests set: HINDCAST_LIB, the worker library (by default
`hindcast_worker`, found as `libhindcast_worker.so` the way morca finds
native libraries); HINDCAST_SOURCE, a base URL or a directory laid out as
NOAA's bucket (the fixtures); HINDCAST_LEADS, the leads in hours, comma
separated (default 0,24,...,168).
