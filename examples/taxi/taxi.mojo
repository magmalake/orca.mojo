"""The NYC yellow-taxi load as a morca pipeline: download each month's TLC
file, load it into a month-partitioned Iceberg table, then compact the months
the run loaded to one file each.

    pixi run -e data taxi
    pixi run -e data ./build/taxi run --partitions 2023-01..2024-12

That's phase 1's gate: 2023-2024 loads to 79,478,796 rows, as taxibench's
table does, and a run killed during the load resumes at the month it was on.
With MORCA_DATABASE_URL set the run is recorded, so `taxi resume <run>` can
finish it.

Phase 2's gate schedules it. The partitions are the months from 2011-01, the
first the TLC publishes in this form, and it fires at 06:00 UTC on the 2nd
for the month before, four runs at most at once:

    pixi run -e data morca
    ./build/morca register ./build/taxi
    ./build/morca backfill taxi 2011-01..2024-12
    ./build/morca scheduler

The TLC publishes a month about two months after it ends, so a fire for the
month just ended fails its download, is retried with backoff and then fails;
a backfill of the month once it's out loads it.

- `MORCA_WAREHOUSE` (default `build/taxi-data/warehouse`): the warehouse that
  holds the dataset `taxi.trips`, created by the first load. `load` declares
  it in `writes=`, and `compact`, which rewrites it, in `reads=` and
  `writes=`.
- `TAXI_TLC` (default `build/taxi-data/tlc`): where the downloads go. A month whose
  file is already there whole isn't downloaded again.
- `TAXI_SOURCE` (default the TLC's URL): where to download from, a URL or a
  local directory of the same files.

The load appends a month in the reader's batches, which leaves about 46 files
per month (220 for 2011's); the compaction rewrites each month the run loaded
as one file, in one `replace` snapshot. It leaves other months alone, so runs
loading different months at once don't rewrite each other's files. Data files written by an attempt killed before it committed aren't
in any snapshot and are left behind; expiring and removing orphans is for
later.
