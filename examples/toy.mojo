"""A three-step pipeline over months: the one tests/cli.sh drives.

    pixi run toy
    ./build/toy describe
    ./build/toy run --partitions 2024-01..2024-03

It's scheduled at 03:00 UTC on the 2nd of each month, for the month before,
from 2024-01, with at most two runs at once: tests/scheduler.sh drives it
through the `morca` scheduler.

A partition whose month is in MORCA_TOY_FAIL (e.g. `2024-02`) fails its
`measure` step, to show the rest of the run carrying on; one in
MORCA_TOY_CRASH aborts the process there, as a crash would (tests/crash.sh).
MORCA_TOY_SLEEP makes
every step take that many seconds, so tests/kill.sh has time to kill it.
