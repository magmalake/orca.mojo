# A step's attempts and commits

One step of one run commits to one table, an attempt at a time. For each
commit the attempt looks through the table's snapshots for one it (or an
earlier attempt of the same step in the same run) already made, commits if
there is none, and records the snapshot in Postgres. Other writers commit to
the table in between, and the worker can crash between any two of these.

Mirrors src/morca/tables.mojo#find_commit+_found+_commit_append and
src/morca/ctx.mojo#Ctx.made+Ctx.summary+Ctx.committed+Ctx.commits_to.
