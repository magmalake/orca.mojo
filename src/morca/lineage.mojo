"""Lineage: which snapshots a dataset's snapshot was made from, and what was
made from it, from the reads and commits every attempt records.

```
morca lineage lake.report            the latest snapshot's, back and forward
morca lineage lake.report 4417...    one snapshot's
```

A snapshot that a morca attempt committed is **made** by that attempt: its
run, pipeline, step, partition and code, and the snapshots it read, its
**inputs**. The walks go over those edges in SQL (recursive CTEs):

- **`back`** from a snapshot: the attempt that made it, then the attempts
  that made each of its inputs, and so on, to inputs no morca attempt made
  (sources: a table written by something else, or a read of a dataset
  before it had any snapshot, which isn't listed).
- **`forward`** from a snapshot: every snapshot made by an attempt that read
  it, then what was made from those, and so on.

Both stop at `depth` steps (default 20), so a deep graph is cut rather than
slow. A snapshot recorded by two attempts (a retry that recognised its
earlier attempt's commit) is listed once, as the nearer and earlier. Only
datasets take part: a table outside the warehouse has no name to follow.
The same edges are in the snapshots' own summaries, as `orca.reads`.
