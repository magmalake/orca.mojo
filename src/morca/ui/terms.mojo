"""What the UI's words mean, in one place: the help on every table's column
headers, and on the values that come from a fixed set (statuses, step
kinds, triggers, placements, where a setting came from), so the same word

header_help("From", "config")     # a column whose meaning depends on its table

```

The UI (`orca.web.page.respond`) adds a header's help to every `<th>` it
finds one for (a `data-help` attribute names a table-specific one), and
`Html.status` and `Html.term` put a value's on its chip or word. Texts are
HTML, written here as `if` chains (`_header`, `_context_header`, `_value`, `_key`), so
they may hold entities; none holds data from a request or a double quote,
as a value's goes in an attribute. An empty text means no help.
