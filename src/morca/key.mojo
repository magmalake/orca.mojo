"""`Key`: what a partition key is, whatever it counts.

A key is written as text (`2024-01`, `2024-01-31`, `log-0f3a`), read back
by `parse`, and ordered, for sorting and display. `Month`, `Day` and
`Hour` are `TimeKey`s too: each has a next and a previous key, and the key a date
falls in, which ranges, schedules' fills and sensors' day-to-month mapping
need. `Name` (`orca.name`) is a key that isn't a date, so asking it for its
next key doesn't compile. `parse_keys` reads the ranges and lists the
command line takes for time keys.
