"""Whether a run's code is outdated, a newer version leading (#397): how a
long run hands over to the next version on its own terms.

A run may last months. A deploy doesn't wait for it and morca never stops
it; instead the run can see that it's outdated, and its code decides what
to do. By default nothing happens.

    from morca import Ctx, outdated

    def follow(mut ctx: Ctx, key: Name) raises -> Int:
        var polls = 0
        while not outdated():
            poll_once()          # one unit of work
            polls += 1
        ctx.log("a newer version leads: handing over")
        return polls

**Where it comes from.** The run's heartbeat thread (`morca.heartbeat`)
asks on each beat, over the connection it beats with (`outdated_sql`), or
in the reply to its beat for a worker's run (`morca.http_store`), and keeps
the answer here, in the process: `outdated()` reads an atomic, so a loop
can call it as often as it likes. It's false until the first beat, and
always for a run with no heartbeat (in memory, or over SQLite).

A run is outdated, while it runs, when either:

- its pipeline is registered with other code than the run's: the version
  `morca register` recorded last (`orca.pipelines.version`) and the one the
  run recorded (`orca.runs.version`), rows of `orca.pipeline_versions`
  (`morca.source`), differ in the source commit (`-D MORCA_COMMIT`), its
  tree's dirtiness or the registry hash. The registry hash alone isn't
  enough: it covers the DAG, not what a step's body does, so a fix inside
  a step keeps it. The image isn't compared: a registration's is where the
  pipeline's remote runs go (`--image`), a run's the one it ran in;
- or the scheduler instance holding the run drains (docs/overlap.md): a
  newer one leads, or it was asked to (`morca-stack drain-old`). This
  covers a deploy of the same code (new settings, say), and builds that
  record no commit.

`code_version()` is the run's version and `desired_code_version()` the
registered one, each as `version_label` writes it: the commit's first 12
characters (`+dirty` after a dirty tree's), else `code <registry hash>`.
