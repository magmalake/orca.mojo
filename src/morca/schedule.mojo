"""Schedules: when a pipeline runs by itself, and which partition it fills.

```mojo
comptime Taxi = Pipeline[
    "taxi", Download, Load, Compact,
    partitions=Monthly["2011-01"],
    schedule=Cron["0 3 2 * *", "America/New_York"],  # 03:00 on the 2nd
    fills=Previous,                                   # last month
]
```

A fire at some time fills the partition the time falls in on the schedule's
wall clock (`Current`), or the one before it (`Previous`, the default): a
monthly load that runs on the 2nd loads the month that just ended.
`catchup=False` tells the scheduler to start only the latest of the fires it
missed while it was down. The scheduler itself is phase 2's next PR; until
then a schedule is declared, checked, and shown by `describe` and `fires`.
