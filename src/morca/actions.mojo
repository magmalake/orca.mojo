"""What `morca ui` does to runs: each action is rows in Postgres that the
scheduler, or the run's own process, acts on.

The UI never starts a pipeline's binary. Starting, resuming, rerunning and
backfilling leave a `queued` run, which the scheduler starts on its next
tick as it starts any other, within `max_runs`; cancelling sets
`cancel_requested`, which a running run sees before its next attempt; an
attempt still going `MORCA_CANCEL_KILL_SECONDS` (60) later is stopped, its
process exiting (`morca.heartbeat`). Pausing a pipeline sets
`pipelines.paused`, and the scheduler starts none of its runs until it's
unpaused. So the UI works the same wherever the
scheduler runs, and retries and limits stay in one place.

Each action returns an `Outcome`: the run it made or acted on, or why it
refused, which is something the person can fix (a bad range, a run that's
still going) rather than an error.
