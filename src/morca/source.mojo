"""Where a pipeline binary's code came from: its git repository and commit,
given at build time:

    mojo build -D MORCA_SOURCE=https://github.com/me/lake \\
        -D MORCA_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse HEAD) \\
        -D MORCA_DIRTY=$(git diff --quiet HEAD && echo 0 || echo 1) ...

or, for the repository and commit, at run time: a binary built without the
defines reads `MORCA_SOURCE` and `MORCA_COMMIT` from its environment, which a
project image sets (`ENV`). An image's programs then don't change with each
commit, so Mojo's compile cache can serve a rebuild (census #153).

`describe` reports them, `morca register` and each run record them as a
version of the pipeline (`orca.pipeline_versions`), and `morca ui` links a
run to the commit it ran. A binary built without them has an empty source
and is shown as such.
