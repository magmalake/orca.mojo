"""Memory pressure (#202): Linux's pressure stall information (PSI) for
memory, read each tick, and the admission rule built on it.

    some avg10=1.53 avg60=0.87 avg300=0.24 total=1234567
    full avg10=0.00 avg60=0.12 avg300=0.03 total=34567

`some` is the share of the last 10, 60 and 300 seconds in which at least
one task was stalled waiting for memory (reclaim, swap-in, refaults);
`full` the share in which every runnable task was. Meta's TMO acts on the
same signal before memory runs out (Weiner et al., ASPLOS 2022).

**Which file** (`find_source`, once per process):

1. `MORCA_MEMORY_PRESSURE_FILE`, if set: that file, whatever it is (tests
   point it at a fixture);
2. on Linux, the cgroup v2 `memory.pressure` of the nearest cgroup, from
   this process's own up, whose `memory.max` is a limit: in a Docker
   container run with `--memory` that's the container's own
   (`/sys/fs/cgroup/memory.pressure`), which stalls when the container
   reaches its limit even with the host at ease;
3. the host's `/proc/pressure/memory`. Inside a container it is the host's
   (PSI isn't namespaced), which is what a container without a limit
   shares;
4. the own cgroup's `memory.pressure` though it has no limit, for a kernel
   with cgroup PSI but no readable `/proc/pressure`;
5. none: macOS, or a kernel built or booted without PSI (`psi=0`). Then
   nothing is held, and the scheduler says so once.

**Admission** (`Admission`): while `some avg10`, less what runs held at
their own memory limits explain (the most of their cgroups' `some avg10`),
is over the limit
(`MORCA_ADMIT_MEMORY_PRESSURE`, percent, default 10; 0 turns it off), no new
run starts on this host; runs already going go on. The hold ends once
`avg10` is under half the limit, or has stayed at most the limit for
`RESUME_SECONDS`, so a reading that hovers at the limit doesn't flap. A
hold that has lasted `MORCA_ADMIT_PRESSURE_GRACE_SECONDS` (600) with none of
morca's runs going on this host lets one run start at a time (`escape`): the
pressure isn't morca's, and morca shouldn't wait for it forever. The caller
logs and alerts once when that happens (`stuck`).

This module reads files and decides; it keeps nothing in a database, so a
step (`memory_pressure`, from `MORCA_MEMORY_PRESSURE_FILE`, which every run
on the local runner, the control host and a worker is given) and the
per-run cgroups of #201 can use it alone.
