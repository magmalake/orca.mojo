"""Runs on Kubernetes: a dista cluster per run, made and removed by the
scheduler (K8S.md).

With `MORCA_RUNNER=kubernetes`, the scheduler starts a run by creating, in
`MORCA_RUNS_NAMESPACE` (default `morca-runs`), from the image the pipeline
was registered with (`morca register --image`):

| Object | |
|---|---|
| A Job, `morca-<run>-<start>` | the driver: `<binary> resume <run>` |
| A Pod and a Service, `morca-<run>-<start>-head` | the dista head, for a pipeline with tasks |
| `workers` Pods, `morca-<run>-<start>-worker-<i>` | dista's workers, for a pipeline with tasks |

All are labelled `orca.run`, `orca.start` (the run's start count),
`morca.pipeline` and `orca.role`, and the head, its Service and the workers
are owned by the Job, so deleting the Job deletes them. The Job has
`activeDeadlineSeconds` (`MORCA_RUN_DEADLINE`, default a day) and
`ttlSecondsAfterFinished` (10 minutes), and `backoffLimit: 0`, as morca
retries runs itself. The driver reaches Postgres through the Secret
`MORCA_RUN_SECRET` (default `morca-db`, key `url`) in that namespace, and the
head through `DISTA_HEAD`; the scheduler's variables named in
`MORCA_RUN_ENV` are copied to every pod.

Every tick, `sweep` deletes the objects of a run that isn't running at that
start any more, and those of a Job that has finished, first appending its
driver pod's log to the run's `driver.log` under `MORCA_LOGS`: what's left after a
run ends, a run restarted on a new cluster, and what a scheduler that was
killed left behind. Each pod's command runs with the sampler beside it
(`morca.sample`, unless `MORCA_SAMPLE_SECONDS=0`), whose lines go to the
pod's log prefixed `orca-sample `; before a finished Job is deleted, each
of its pods' lines are kept in the run's `metrics/<pod>.jsonl` and left out
of `driver.log`. A run ends when its driver says so, before its pods
have, so the Job of a run that ended in the last `MORCA_KUBE_SETTLE_SECONDS`
(30) is kept until it finishes: its pods' last lines and samples are in
their logs by then, even a run shorter than its sampler's start. A pod deleted before its Job finishes takes its samples
with it, as it does its log. Pods ask for `MORCA_DRIVER_CPU`, `MORCA_HEAD_CPU` and
`MORCA_WORKER_CPU` (default 500m, 250m and 1) and `MORCA_POD_MEMORY` (512Mi)
each; `cpu_millis` is a run's total, which the scheduler checks against
`MORCA_VCPU_BUDGET` before making a cluster.
