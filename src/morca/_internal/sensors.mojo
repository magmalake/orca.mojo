"""Runs started by datasets: sensors, and rebuilds downstream of a dataset.

```
morca rebuild raw.events 2024-03           every pipeline downstream, in order
```

**Sensors.** A pipeline declared `sensor=True` runs when a dataset it reads
(and doesn't write itself) gets a snapshot. The scheduler learns of one in
two ways (`morca._internal.scheduler`): from `orca.commits`, for a snapshot a
succeeded run of another pipeline committed, and by polling `<binary>
sense` every `MORCA_SENSE_SECONDS` (default 60), for a snapshot something
other than morca committed. `orca.sensed` holds a row per pipeline and
snapshot seen, with the run it started, inserted in the transaction that
queues the run, so a snapshot starts one run however many ticks (or
schedulers) see it. The snapshots a tick sees for one pipeline start one
run, over all the partitions they hold.

A sensor counts from when it's registered as one: the snapshots its
datasets have then are recorded as seen without a run, and commits from
before then are ignored. A backfill or a rebuild covers what came before.

**Partitions.** A snapshot a morca run committed holds the partition of
the step that committed it, or the run's partitions for a gather step. One
committed by something else holds what its summary's `orca.partitions`
says, and without that the downstream pipeline runs the partition its
schedule's next fire would fill now, or, unscheduled, the one now falls in.
`map_keys` moves keys between kinds by containment: a day is the month it's
in, and a month is each of its days. Keys before a pipeline's first
partition are dropped.

**Rebuilds.** `rebuild` queues runs for every pipeline downstream of a
dataset, whether or not it's a sensor, over the keys given, mapped to each
pipeline's kind. A pipeline runs at its longest distance from the dataset
(level 0 reads it), so one that reads two rebuilt datasets runs after both.
The plan is `orca.rebuild_pipelines`; `advance_rebuilds`, on every tick,
queues a level's runs once every run before it has succeeded, and stops at
one that failed or was cancelled, which resuming the run from the UI
continues. A rebuild's commits don't start sensors in pipelines the rebuild
runs itself.
