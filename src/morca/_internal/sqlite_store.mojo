"""morca's runs in a SQLite file: `SqliteStore`, for single-node morca.

A pipeline binary takes `MORCA_DATABASE_URL=sqlite:<path>` (or
`sqlite://<path>`, so `sqlite:///var/orca/runs.db` is an absolute path):
`run`, `resume` and `status` then keep pipelines, runs, steps, attempts,
reads and commits in that file, through sqlite-mojo, with nothing to
operate. A run killed anywhere is resumed from the file as from Postgres,
by the same `RunStore` code path. The scheduler, the UI and morca's other
commands stay on Postgres (`morca._internal.state.State` refuses a SQLite URL).

The tables are Postgres's, under the same names without the `orca.` schema,
holding what a pipeline binary writes: steps' inputs and outputs are hex
text, times are Unix seconds (`julianday` based, to the millisecond). The
schema is `morca._internal.db.sqlite_schema`'s, the queries `morca._internal.db.sqlite_runs`'.

**Concurrency.** The file is in WAL mode, so readers (`status`, `sqlite3`)
don't block the writer and the writer doesn't block them. There is one
writer at a time: each change is one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction, which
takes the file's write lock up front, and a writer that finds it taken
waits up to a second (`busy_timeout`), then fails; the owned run's writes
are retried, reopening the file, for `MORCA_DB_RETRY_SECONDS`, as `PgStore`
reconnects. That serialises several runs' processes on one machine, which
is fine for steps that take seconds and rows that take microseconds; it
isn't meant for hundreds of runs at once. Claims are a single guarded
`UPDATE`, so two resumes racing for a run can't both win, and every attempt
checks ownership in its own transaction, as on Postgres. The file must be
on a local disk: SQLite's locks don't hold over NFS and most network file
systems, so two machines must not share one.

`synchronous = FULL`: a commit is on disk before it returns, so a power
loss, not only a killed process, keeps every recorded attempt.
