"""Where attempts' logs, drivers' logs and runs' timelines go.

With `MORCA_LOGS` set, each attempt logs to
`<MORCA_LOGS>/<pipeline>/<run>/<step>/<partition>/<attempt>.log` (the
partition is `_run` for a gather step, and a keyed one's `/` is written
`%2F`, `morca.name.path_segment`), a run of a pipeline with dista
tasks leaves its timeline at `<MORCA_LOGS>/<pipeline>/<run>/timeline.json`,
and the scheduler keeps a run's output at `.../<run>/driver.log`. Without
it, logs go to stdout only.

`MORCA_LOGS` is a directory, or a location in object storage such as
`s3://bucket/morca/logs` (objectstore's `FileIOResolver`, configured from the
`AWS_*` environment). An object can't be appended to, so for a remote root
a log is written to a staging file under `MORCA_LOG_STAGE` (default
`$TMPDIR/morca-logs`) and `publish`ed when it's complete: an attempt's when
the attempt ends, a timeline when the run does. `attempts.log` records
where the log ends up, which `read_location` reads either way.

Secrets are masked in every log written here: `MORCA_SECRETS` names the
environment variables that hold a run's secrets (`morca register --secret`),
and `mask` replaces their values with `***`.
