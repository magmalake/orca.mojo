"""morca's state in Postgres: pipelines, runs, steps and attempts.

Everything lives in the `morca` schema, which `State.migrate` creates and
brings up to date; migrations are SQL in `_migrations`, applied in order
under a transaction-scoped advisory lock, so two processes starting at once
don't both apply one.

**One writer per run.** The process running a run is its `owner` and keeps
`runs.heartbeat` fresh from a thread (`morca._internal.heartbeat`). `State.claim` takes
a run only if its heartbeat is older than the stale limit, or cleared, which
`finish_run` does when a run ends. Every attempt checks in the same
transaction that this process still owns the run, so a process that lost its
run to a resume stops at its next step instead of racing it. The same check
stops a run that was asked to cancel (`runs.cancel_requested`, which `morca
ui` sets) before its next attempt; an attempt already going finishes and is
recorded.

**Each change is one transaction.** Starting an attempt marks its step
running and inserts the attempt; finishing it records the output or the
error on both. A process killed in between leaves an attempt `running`,
which `interrupt` marks failed when the run is resumed.
