"""Runs on EC2: a head instance and worker instances per run, started and
ended by the scheduler (DESIGN.md, phase 5, PR 5).

With `MORCA_RUNNER=ec2` the scheduler starts a run's start `s` as:

- **a head instance** (`--head-type` at registration, else
  `MORCA_EC2_HEAD_TYPE`, on-demand): the dista head, for a pipeline with
  tasks, and the driver, `<binary> resume <run>`, beside it on localhost;
- **`workers` worker instances** (`--worker-type`, else
  `MORCA_EC2_WORKER_TYPE`; Spot with `--spot`), for a pipeline with tasks,
  started straight after with `DISTA_HEAD` at the head's private address.

Each is tagged `orca.run`, `orca.start`, `morca.pipeline` and `orca.role`,
told to terminate when it shuts down, and started from user data that runs
the pipeline's image (`MORCA_EC2_MODE=docker`, the default: `docker run
--network host`, after `MORCA_EC2_PREAMBLE`, such as an ECR login) or the
binary itself (`direct`, for the tests' stand-in EC2), then shuts down
(`MORCA_EC2_SHUTDOWN`). The head keeps the driver's output in the run's
`driver.log` (`<binary> keep-log`) before it does, and if the driver
crashed, fails the attempts it left running with the crash's first frames
(`morca._internal.crash`). Beside its work each
instance runs `<binary> sample` (`morca._internal.sample`; in docker mode as a
container with `--pid host`), whose lines its script uploads to the run's
`metrics/<role>-<instance>.jsonl` with its log (`<binary> put-log`), every
`MORCA_CLUSTER_LOG_SECONDS` and once when it ends, after telling the
sampler to write a last line and stop (`--until`).

With `--worker-procs N` (`auto`: one per vCPU of the worker type) each
worker instance's script starts `N` dista worker processes against the same
head, rather than one, since a process runs one task at a time: each takes
a port of its own, so they share the host. The script notes one that exits,
forwards a SIGTERM to all of them, and shuts the instance down once the last
has gone. Counts and costs stay in instances (`workers`, the budget); a
worker's log is its processes' logs joined.

A pipeline registered with `--workers MIN..MAX` scales: its run starts
`MIN` workers, which may be none, and every tick `scale` reads the head's
demand (`dista status --json`, from port 6390 on the head's private address,
through the pipeline's binary: `<binary> dista-status`, since dista's
sockets can't share morca's binary with flare's) and asks
`dista.scale.decide` what to do. It starts the workers asked for,
up to `MAX`, and drains the ones named with `dista drain`; a drained worker
exits once its work and results have moved, and its instance's script shuts
it down. `MORCA_SCALE_UP_AFTER` (5 s), `MORCA_SCALE_IDLE` (60 s) and
`MORCA_SCALE_STEP` (4) tune the policy. The budget counts `MAX`.

A run is scaled, and its workers are started, as its pipeline was registered
when the run started (`orca.runs.spec`, kept at each start), so registering
the pipeline again meanwhile doesn't strand a live run on settings it never
had; its next start takes the new registration.

A run that needs workers (`MAX` above 0) whose head has tasks waiting and no
worker for `MORCA_NO_WORKERS_SECONDS` (600; 0 turns it off) has the attempt
that waits fail with `no workers joined in 10 min (tasks waiting: N)`, and
its instances terminated. Its driver stops beating with them, so the
scheduler starts it again as it does a run whose process died, until its
retries are spent. Since when it has waited is `orca.runs.waiting_since`,
which the run's page shows. `timeout_seconds` on a step bounds an attempt
whatever it waits for.

A pipeline's secrets (`--secret NAME=ID`) are read by each instance's
script at start, after the preamble, with `aws secretsmanager
get-secret-value` (`MORCA_SECRET_FETCH` replaces the command, which is given
the ID), exported as NAME, given to the containers, and named in
`MORCA_SECRETS` so that every log morca writes masks them.

Every tick, `sweep` terminates the instances of runs that aren't running at
that start, and those older than `MORCA_RUN_DEADLINE` (a day). A head whose
run has just ended is left `MORCA_EC2_HEAD_GRACE` seconds (60) to finish its
script: keep the driver's log, upload its own and its samples, and shut
itself down. Instances get
`MORCA_EC2_DATABASE_URL` as `MORCA_DATABASE_URL` (the control instance's
private address), the warehouse, the logs, the region and the scheduler's
variables named in `MORCA_RUN_ENV`; `MORCA_EC2_AMI`, `MORCA_EC2_SUBNET`,
`MORCA_EC2_SECURITY_GROUP` and `MORCA_EC2_PROFILE` say where and as what they
run. `cpu_millis` is a run's instances' vCPUs, which the scheduler checks
against `MORCA_VCPU_BUDGET` first.

**The warm pool** (`MORCA_EC2_POOL_SECONDS`, 150; 0 turns it off). An
instance's script is then a loop over runs, and the next run of the same
pipeline, started as the same instances, takes its head and workers rather
than launching new ones:

- **The key.** Each instance's row has a digest of what it was started as
  (`pool_key`): role, type, market, AMI, subnet, security group, profile,
  the pipeline's registry hash, and its script but for the first run's
  line, which holds the image, binary, secrets' IDs, the environment it was
  given and its worker processes. A run takes only instances of its own
  keys, so a new registration, image or setting never reuses old ones.
- **Back to the pool.** A head's driver exits; a worker's `<binary>
  pool-wait` (`morca._internal.pool`) sees its run end and the script kills its dista
  processes, which don't end with their head. Each uploads that run's logs
  and samples and runs `<binary> pool-next`, which marks the run's row
  `idle` and beats `polled` every second until it's handed a run. Its run's
  row stays live meanwhile, so idle instances count against the budget (a
  run of the same keys counts them as its own), and `/ops/pools` shows them as
  `idle (pooled)`. A start of a pipeline waits while instances of its keys
  are still on their way there (at most the head's grace).
- **Hand-over** (`_take`). In one transaction, the idle rows of the key
  whose run has ended, that weren't drained and that beat within
  `MORCA_EC2_POOL_LIVE_SECONDS` (5) are locked `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`,
  checked with `DescribeInstances`, ended (`pooled: on to run N`) and
  replaced by rows of the new run (`pooled`); `pool-next` sees its new row,
  records that it `joined`, and the next pass runs it: a new dista head
  process for the head, new worker processes pointed at the run's head,
  secrets read again, and logs and samples under the new run. A run takes
  pooled workers up to what it starts (`MIN`, and what `scale` adds), then
  launches the rest; the others stay pooled.
- **Failure.** One handed a run that hasn't joined within
  `MORCA_EC2_POOL_JOIN_SECONDS` (30) is terminated (`pooled: never took the
  run up`) and replaced: a worker by a new worker, a head by new instances
  for the same start. The sweep ends idle instances after
  `MORCA_EC2_POOL_SECONDS` (`pooled: idle N s, shut down`), those that stop
  beating, and those that don't reach the pool within the head's grace;
  their rows end before they're terminated, so one handed on meanwhile
  isn't. An instance's tags keep its first run; the sweep goes by its live
  row. A run that's restarted, or a worker that was drained, ends as
  before.
