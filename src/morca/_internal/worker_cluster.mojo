"""The processes of one run's dista cluster on a remote worker (#268,
`morca._internal.run_cluster`): the head and a dista worker beside the run's driver
on the worker that starts it, and a dista worker on each one that joins.

Every one of them gets the run's cluster token as `DISTA_TOKEN` (dista
refuses a connection without it) and its address as `DISTA_ADVERTISE`, the
one `morca worker --advertise` says the pool's machines reach it at. A
member's dista worker gives up on a head that's gone after
`DISTA_CONNECT_TIMEOUT` (10 s), as well as being stopped when its run ends.
