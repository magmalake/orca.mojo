"""Placement: where a pipeline's runs run (`morca register --placement`), and
the control runner, which runs them on the scheduler's own host.

A pipeline's placement is `default` (stored as null: the scheduler's runner,
`MORCA_RUNNER`, as before), `ec2` (instances of their own, `morca._internal.ec2`; on a
scheduler whose runner isn't `ec2` such runs wait, saying why),
`worker:<pool>` (a remote worker of that pool starts them, `orca.workers`,
never the scheduler) or `control`:
the scheduler starts the run as a child process of its own, the pipeline's
binary with `resume <run>` as the local runner does, which on AWS is in the
scheduler's container on the control instance (the binary is the project's
image's). Small runs then start in a second, without an instance to boot.

**Limits**, so a run can't starve Postgres, the scheduler or the UI:

- **Memory.** Each tick the scheduler adds up the resident memory of each
  control-placed run's process tree (`morca._internal.sample.tree_rss`) and kills one
  over `MORCA_CONTROL_MEMORY_MB` (1024), failing its attempts with why. Its
  processes are also the first the kernel kills if memory runs out before
  that (`oom_score_adj` 1000, on Linux).
- **CPU.** Its processes run at `nice` `MORCA_CONTROL_NICE` (10), so the
  control instance's own processes win when the cores are busy.
- **How many.** At most `MORCA_CONTROL_MAX_RUNS` (2) control-placed runs, of
  all pipelines, run at once.
- **Pressure.** None starts while the control instance's newest minute
  (`morca._internal.system`, from its sampler) has memory or its fullest disk over 85%.

A run held by either of the last two stays queued with the reason in
`runs.held`, which its page and JSON show. dista inside such a run is in
local mode, `MORCA_CONTROL_WORKERS` (1) forked workers.

**Secrets** (`--secret NAME=ID`) are read by the scheduler when it starts
the run, with `MORCA_SECRET_FETCH` as the instances read them, else from
Secrets Manager's API with the scheduler's credentials (the image has no
`aws` command), and put in the run's environment only, with `MORCA_SECRETS`
naming them so its logs mask them. Its driver's output is kept in a staging
file and appended to the run's `driver.log`, masked, by `<binary> keep-log`
once the process has ended, as on an EC2 head.
