"""The pool autoscaler (#267): machines for the pools morca.toml declares
(`morca._internal.pool_config`), made and removed by the leading scheduler every
`MORCA_POOL_SCALE_SECONDS` (15).

**Demand.** A pool needs a machine while runs of its pipelines (placement
`worker:<pool>`, not paused) have been queued `MORCA_POOL_GROW_AFTER`
seconds (20) that a worker could start: no more of a pipeline's than
`max_runs` less its running ones, and its fill runs. Workers already in
the pool take what they have room for first; what's left waiting is the
demand.

**Growing.** While there's demand, no machine of the pool is still booting
(made, its worker not yet seen) and it has fewer than `max_machines`, the
autoscaler makes one, at most once every `MORCA_POOL_TRY_SECONDS` (60):

- it tries the type it's on (the first, to start with) in each location in
  turn; the first that the provider has is made;
- a type the worker image has no variant for (`morca._internal.registry`: the
  machine's architecture, as the provider says it, isn't among the
  image's) is skipped, saying so;
- when no location has the type, it keeps trying it until the type's
  `wait` has passed since it started, then moves to the next; the last has
  no wait and is tried for as long as there's demand;
- once one is made, or the demand goes, it starts again from the first.

The machine is named `orca-pool-<pool>-<n>`, labelled with the pool and this
stack's id (`orca.stack_identity`, so a project several stacks share keeps
them apart), and booted as a worker (`morca._internal.pool_boot`) with a token of its
own. `orca.pools.status` says what the last attempt came to.

**Shrinking.** A machine is removed (its token revoked, then the machine
deleted, then its row ended with why) when:

- it has run nothing for its pool's `idle_seconds` and the pool has no
  demand;
- its pool is no longer in morca.toml, once it's idle;
- its worker never showed up within `MORCA_POOL_BOOT_SECONDS` (900), or went
  silent for `MORCA_POOL_LOST_SECONDS` (300): its runs are queued again as
  any lost worker's are (`morca._internal.pool_runs`).

**Strays.** A machine of the provider's with the pool's and this stack's
labels that `orca.pool_machines` doesn't have live (made, but the row
wasn't written) is deleted.
