"""An EC2 instance's side of the warm pool (`morca._internal.ec2`,
`MORCA_EC2_POOL_SECONDS`): the two commands its script runs between runs,
through the pipeline's binary, over `MORCA_DATABASE_URL`.

```
<binary> pool-wait <instance> <run> <start>             a worker: until its run is over
<binary> pool-next <instance> <run> <start> <seconds>   until it's handed another run
```

The scheduler hands an idle instance to a run by ending its row in
`orca.instances` and inserting one for the new run, `pooled`, in one
transaction. So the instance learns of its next run from its own rows, and
Postgres, which every instance reaches already, is the only channel: no
other service, port or permission. `pool-next` marks the row of the run the
instance served `idle` (its work has stopped: the head's driver and dista
head have exited, a worker's processes are killed), and beats `polled`
every second, which the scheduler checks before it hands the instance out.
When a new row appears, it records that it `joined`, prints `next <run>
<start> <head address> <0|1>` (the last, whether the run may use new code) and
exits 0; when its row ends with no other (the scheduler shut the idle
instance down), or `seconds` and a minute more pass, it exits 1 and the
script shuts the instance down.

`pool-wait`, beside a worker's processes, exits 0 once the run isn't running
at that start any more, or the worker's row has ended: dista workers don't
end with their head, so this is how a worker knows to stop. Both ride out
a database that can't be reached for a while, retrying every second.
