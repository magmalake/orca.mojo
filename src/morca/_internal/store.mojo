"""Where the executor records what it does.

`Pipeline.execute` reports every attempt it starts and finishes, and every
step it skips, to a `Store`; a step's reads and commits reach the same store
through the `Recorder` its `Ctx` holds. `MemoryStore` keeps them in the
process, for a run that lives as long as it does; `morca._internal.state.PgStore`
writes them to Postgres, so a run can be resumed by another process.

`RunStore` is a `Store` that also keeps runs: the rest of what a pipeline
binary (`morca._internal.cli`) asks of persistence, from registering the pipeline to
ending its run, so the binary depends on this trait and nothing else.
Both backends' SQL is in `morca._internal.db` (`morca._internal.db.runs`, `morca._internal.db.steps`,
`morca._internal.db.sqlite_runs`), as is the scheduler's and the UI's.
