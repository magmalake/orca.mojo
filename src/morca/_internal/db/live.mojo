"""Which runs are live: queued, deferred, or running with their process
alive, as SQL the other queries build on (`live_sql`, `dead_sql`, ...).

A running run's process is taken to have died when its heartbeat is older
than the stale limit (`MORCA_STALE_SECONDS`), or, before its first beat, when
the scheduler started it longer ago than the start grace
(`MORCA_START_SECONDS`). A live run holds its partition keys: the
scheduler, sensors, rebuilds and the UI's start queue no second run over a
key a live run has.

**Held by its scheduler instance.** A local or control-placed run started
by an `morca scheduler` with MORCA_OVERLAP=on records that instance
(`runs.instance`, a row of `orca.schedulers`: docs/overlap.md). It isn't
dead while that instance has been seen within the stale limit and lists
it among its runs, whatever its heartbeat: the instance kills a
process whose heartbeat went stale, reaps it, and only then is the run
dead. So while two instances overlap in a deploy, the one that leads
counts the draining one's runs and leaves them alone.
