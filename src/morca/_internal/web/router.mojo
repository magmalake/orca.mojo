"""The router: a table of routes, each a method, a path pattern, what kind
of request it is and the handler that answers it. `morca._internal.web.routes` is the
table; `morca._internal.web.server` looks a request up here and wraps the handler in
what its kind needs.

A pattern is the path's segments: a literal (`runs`), a parameter
(`{name}`: any segment but an empty one, URL-decoded) or a number
(`{id:int}`). A path matches a route of its length whose literals are its
segments and whose numbers parse. A path that would match but for a number
that isn't one (`/runs/x`, `/runs/1/attempts/x/log`) is answered 404,
"no run x", from the route's `noun`.

A `GET` route answers `HEAD` too. A read (`GET`) that matches nothing is
404, "nothing at <path>"; a `POST` that matches nothing is 405, since only
the actions take one, unless it's an action's but for its number, which
is 404.
