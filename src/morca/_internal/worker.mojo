"""`morca worker`: runs a pool's runs on this machine, talking only to
`morca ui`'s API.

```
MORCA_WORKER_TOKEN=orca_... morca worker --pool bgent --remote https://orca.mlake.dev
```

Every `--poll-seconds` (2) the worker posts its heartbeat to
`/api/worker/claim` (`orca.workers`), its name, image, CPUs, memory and
the runs it has, and, while it has fewer than `--max-runs` (1), asks for
one. A run it's given starts as the local runner starts one: the
pipeline's binary (the path it was registered with, which the worker's
image has too) with `resume <run>`, in a process group of its own, its
output staged under `--dir` (`$TMPDIR/morca-worker`), with the pipeline's
`env`, its secrets read here with `MORCA_SECRET_FETCH` and named in
`MORCA_SECRETS`, and `MORCA_STATE_URL` and `MORCA_STATE_TOKEN` in place of a
database: the run records itself over the API (`morca.http_store`). Its
data and logs go where the worker's own `MORCA_WAREHOUSE` and `MORCA_LOGS`
say, as any run's do. When the process ends, its output is appended to
the run's `driver.log` by `<binary> keep-log`, which also fails the
attempts a crash left running; a process that ended before claiming its
run has the run failed, saying why (`/api/worker/exited`). Beside each
run's process it starts `<binary> sample` (`morca.sample`, unless
`MORCA_SAMPLE_SECONDS=0`), which writes this machine's metrics to
`<MORCA_LOGS>/<pipeline>/<run>/metrics/worker-<name>.jsonl`, so the run's
page has its Machines card, as a local run's does. Each poll the
worker samples its runs' process trees, as the scheduler samples a local
run's, and sends the samples with `/api/worker/exited`, so their attempts
get their peak memory and CPU (`morca.usage`). Where the worker can make
cgroups (`morca._internal.cgroup`), each run gets one at its grant, and an
out-of-memory kill is reported with `/api/worker/exited`, which fails the
attempts saying so and raises what the pipeline asks for.

**No database.** The worker refuses to start with `MORCA_DATABASE_URL` set:
nothing on a worker holds database credentials. Its token is
`MORCA_WORKER_TOKEN`, or the first line of `--token-file`; one that's
revoked, expired or for another pool than `--pool` is refused, and the
worker exits (code 3).

**Versions.** The worker's image is `--image`, else `MORCA_IMAGE`. A run it's
given whose pipeline's image isn't that is put back (`/api/worker/release`)
rather than started, though the UI shouldn't hand it one
(`orca.workers.version_refusal`).

**Dying.** A worker that's killed takes its runs with it: each run's
heartbeat thread exits its process once its parent isn't the worker
(`MORCA_WORKER_PID`), so the run's heartbeat goes stale and the scheduler
queues it again, for this worker or another, whatever its trigger
(`morca.scheduler`'s `_requeue_lost`); a run this worker claimed and never
started has its start given back.
