"""Snapshot expiry, the scheduler's half: what morca still needs of a
dataset's history, and the binary that does the expiring.

Expiring needs iceberg, which the `morca` binary doesn't link, so it runs in
the project's `morca_maintain` binary (`morca._internal.maintain`). This side decides
what must survive whatever the table's policy says, from Postgres:

- **the snapshots a run that can still go on has read.** A step's reads are
  pinned: a retry or `resume` scans the snapshot the first attempt read,
  so a queued, running, deferred or failed run keeps every snapshot its
  attempts read. (A failed run can be resumed; a succeeded or cancelled one
  can't, and is let go.)
- **the snapshots such a run committed.** A retry finds the commits its
  step made before it was killed by looking through the table's snapshots
  (`morca.tables.find_commit`); one that was expired would be committed a
  second time.
- **every snapshot of the last run that committed to the dataset**, so an
  expiry never leaves fewer than one run's worth of history.

What expiry costs: `morca lineage` and the UI's dataset and snapshot pages
read Postgres only, so they still show an expired snapshot, what made it
and what it was made from; but the snapshot itself is gone from the table,
so it can no longer be read (time travel, `use_snapshot`), and a `rebuild`
reruns the pipelines from the current data, not from it.
