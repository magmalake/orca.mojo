"""What a run's processes use: each attempt's peak memory and CPU.

Whoever starts a run's process measures it: the scheduler for a local or
control-placed run (`morca._internal.scheduler`), `morca worker` for a remote worker's
(`morca._internal.worker`). Each tick, at most every quarter of a second, it reads
the process's tree in /proc (`morca._internal.sample.tree_usage`: the driver and what
it started, dista's local workers among them) and keeps a `Meter` of it:
the resident bytes, the CPU seconds so far (utime + stime, with what the
tree's processes waited for), and the cores that kept busy since the
sample before. When the process is reaped, `wait4` adds its own word:
`ru_maxrss`, the largest single process (a lower bound on the tree's), and
its CPU seconds, which count descendants that ended after the last sample.

A process runs every attempt of a run's start, so its samples are shared
out among those attempts by time (`attribute`): an attempt's peak is the
largest sample taken while it ran (or, for one shorter than a tick, the
sample just after it), its CPU the meter's CPU at its end less at its
start, its peak cores the busiest interval it overlapped. `ru_maxrss`
raises the peak of a process's only attempt. A meter keeps at most
`MAX_MARKS` samples, merging neighbours as it fills (keeping their maximum
and the later total), so a long run's samples are coarser, not dropped.

On macOS, which has no /proc, there are no samples: a process's only
attempt gets `wait4`'s numbers, and none gets its peak cores; a process
of several attempts records none. Runs on EC2 or Kubernetes, and runs no
scheduler or worker started (`<binary> run` by hand), record nothing:
their columns stay NULL.

The numbers are `orca.attempts`' `peak_rss_bytes`, `cpu_seconds` and
`peak_cpus` (migration 35), written once, when the process ends: by the
scheduler over Postgres, and for a worker's run by `morca ui`, which the
worker sends its meter with `/api/worker/exited` (`marks_json`, ages in
seconds before the request, so neither clock needs to agree with the
database's).
