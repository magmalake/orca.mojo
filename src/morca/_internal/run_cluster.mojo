"""One run's dista cluster over several workers of a pool (#268), the UI's
side: the run's head, the members that join it, and when they stop.

- **The head.** A pipeline placed `worker:<pool>` with `workers = N` set
  (its run spreads over up to N more machines) is started by the worker
  that claims it as a cluster of its own, when that worker says the
  address the pool's machines reach it at (`morca worker --advertise`): a
  dista head on a free port, a dista worker, and the run's driver. It
  reports the head's address and the run's cluster token
  (`/api/worker/cluster`, `report_head`), kept on the run
  (`orca.runs.cluster_head`, `cluster_token`) for this start only.
- **Members.** A worker of the pool with room, and an address, that has no
  run to start is given one to join (`join_claim`): a running run of the
  pool whose head is known, with fewer live members than its `workers`,
  that isn't already this worker's. It's sized as a run of the pipeline
  would be on that machine, counted against the machine's room with its
  runs, and kept in `orca.run_members`. The worker starts a dista worker
  against the head, with the token (dista's `DISTA_TOKEN`: nothing without
  it joins), and says when it ends (`/api/worker/left`, `member_left`).
- **Stopping.** Each claim's answer lists this worker's members whose run
  isn't running at that start any more (`members_to_stop`): the worker
  kills them, and they're ended "its run ended".

The token reaches a member only in a claim's answer, over the worker API's
TLS, and is never in a log or a page.
