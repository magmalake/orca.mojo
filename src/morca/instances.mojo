"""Scheduler instances: two `morca scheduler`s of different images overlapping
on one Postgres during a deploy (docs/overlap.md).

With `MORCA_OVERLAP=on`, each `morca scheduler` has a row in
`orca.schedulers`, kept fresh on every tick with the runs its processes
are. One instance leads: it holds the session advisory lock `LEAD_LOCK`,
and only it decides (fires, sensors, retries, starts, alerts, sweeps). The
newest live instance takes the lead: an older one that sees a newer one
live, or is asked to (`morca scheduler drain`), gives the lock up and
drains: it starts nothing, keeps supervising the processes it started
until they end, then ends its row and exits. A run an instance started
records it (`runs.instance`), and `morca.live.held_sql` keeps it live while
the instance lists it, so the leader counts it and leaves it alone.

An instance is live while it has been seen within the stale limit and
hasn't ended; "gone" is the opposite, and only then are its runs, once
their heartbeats are stale too, queued again (`Scheduler._requeue_orphans`).
