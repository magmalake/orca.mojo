"""`Name`: the partition key of a keyed pipeline (`orca.keyed`).

A name is 1 to 128 bytes of `[A-Za-z0-9._:/-]` without two dots in a row,
such as a log's UUID or a repository's `owner/name`. A `/` separates
segments, so a name doesn't start or end with one or have two in a row.
Neither a comma nor `..` can appear in one, so a list of names on the
command line or in `runs.partitions` reads back unambiguously. Names order
by their bytes. A name has no next or previous name and falls in no date:
it's a `Key` but not a `TimeKey`.

Wherever a name becomes one segment of a path or a URL (an attempt's log,
`/pipelines/<name>/keys/<key>`), it goes through `path_segment`, which
writes `/` as `%2F`; no other byte of a name needs escaping.
