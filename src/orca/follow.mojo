"""How far a dated sensor pipeline is behind the datasets it follows.

A sensor (`orca.sensors`) runs when a dataset it reads, and doesn't write,
gets a snapshot, over the snapshot's partitions. What it follows has, then,
is every partition of those datasets that orca knows of:

- each snapshot a succeeded attempt of another pipeline committed
  (`orca.commits`), holding its step's partition, or the run's partitions
  for a gather step, as the sensor reads them;
- each snapshot the sensor saw otherwise (`orca.sensed`, from `<binary>
  sense`), holding the partitions of the run it started.

Those keys, in the sensor's kind and range (from its start to today), are
what it could have done; `follow` gives each its state as the calendar
does (`orca.calendar`), so what's behind splits into running or queued,
failed, and not queued yet. A single query reads the keys (through the
`commits_snapshot` index), then the calendar's three.
