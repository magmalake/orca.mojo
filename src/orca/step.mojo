"""Steps: the functions a pipeline runs, and the edges between them.

A step wraps a top-level `def` with a name, its input and output types, its
kind, and the step it follows:

```mojo
def download(mut ctx: Ctx, month: Month) raises -> RawFile: ...
def load(mut ctx: Ctx, raw: RawFile) raises -> Loaded: ...
def compact(mut ctx: Ctx, loaded: Seq[Loaded]) raises -> Int64: ...

comptime Download = Step["download", Month, RawFile, download, Mapped]
comptime Load = Step["load", RawFile, Loaded, load, Mapped, after=Download]
comptime Compact = Step["compact", Seq[Loaded], Int64, compact, Gather, after=Load]
```

A mapped step runs once per partition of a run, a gather step once per run.
The edge is checked when the pipeline is compiled:

| Step | Its input must be |
|---|---|
| first, mapped | the pipeline's partition key, such as `Month` |
| first, gather | a `Seq` of the key, every partition of the run |
| mapped, after a mapped step | that step's output |
| gather, after a mapped step | `Seq` of that step's output, one per partition in run order |
| gather, after a gather step | that step's output |

A mapped step can't follow a gather step. Types are compared by their
reflected names, which include their module; the first step's input is
checked by `Pipeline.check`, which knows the key.

A step declares the datasets it reads and writes, as `namespace.table`
names in the warehouse (`orca.tables`):

```mojo
comptime Clean = Step[
    "clean", Month, Int64, clean, Mapped,
    reads=["raw.events"], writes=["lake.events"],
]
```

A dataset in `replaces=` instead is one the step writes whose partitions a
new run *replaces* rather than appends to: `orca.tables.append` and
`append_files` to it make the run's first commit to each partition an
`overwrite` that removes what earlier runs left there, so
`orca backfill --rerun` leaves one copy of a key's rows (`orca.tables`,
"Replacing partitions"). A dataset in `replaces=` counts as written; it
needn't be in `writes=` as well.

```mojo
comptime Load = Step[
    "load", Day, Int64, load, Mapped, replaces=["gharchive.events"],
]
```

A step that fails is tried again up to `retries` times in the same run,
at once, or after `backoff_seconds` doubling with each retry:

```mojo
comptime Fetch = Step[
    "fetch", Month, RawFile, fetch, Mapped, retries=3, backoff_seconds=30,
]
```

A step that can't do its work yet, such as a download that isn't
published or an API that's out of requests, raises `defer(seconds, why)`
instead of failing: the attempt ends `deferred`, spending no retry, and its
run ends `deferred` and is started again by the scheduler that many seconds
later, without counting against `run_retries` (`orca.scheduler`).

`timeout_seconds=N` bounds an attempt: one still going N seconds after it
started is stopped (`orca.heartbeat`), as a failed attempt, and its run
fails, to be retried by the scheduler as any failed run is. A step can't be
interrupted where it is, so the run's process exits: its other partitions
and the step's own retries wait for the run's retry.

`orca.tables` refuses a scan of a dataset the step didn't declare in
`reads`, and a commit to one it didn't declare in `writes`, so the graph of
pipelines and datasets that `describe` gives is what the steps do.
