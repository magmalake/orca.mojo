"""Stopping `orca ui` without dropping a request. `docker stop` sends
SIGTERM and waits 10 s before it kills; Ctrl-C sends SIGINT. Either one
starts a drain:

1. The listening socket closes, so a new connection is refused at once
   (one waiting in its backlog is reset).
2. The requests already in the handler finish and their answers go out;
   so does one a kept-alive connection sends meanwhile.
3. Once no request has been in the handler for 200 ms, or after
   `ORCA_UI_DRAIN_SECONDS` (default 8, under `docker stop`'s 10), the
   server's loop stops, which closes the kept-alive connections, and
   `orca ui` exits 0. A request still running half a second after that
   can't be cut short (the handler runs on the loop's thread), so the
   process then exits 1 without it.

A second signal during the drain stops the loop at once.

A signal handler can't reach a Mojo variable, so it writes a byte to a pipe
whose write end is duplicated onto a fixed descriptor, `WAKE_FD`, and a
thread of its own waits on the read end (as `dista.signals` does for a
worker). The handler runs on whichever thread the kernel picks, and `write`
is async-signal-safe; `signal` installs it with `SA_RESTART`, so a query
it interrupts goes on.

Flare's `HttpServer.drain(timeout_ms)` always waits out its whole window,
since its loop publishes no count of what's in flight, so the drain counts
the requests in the handler itself (`Counting`) and stops the loop with
`HttpServer.close()` once there are none.
