# Datasets on steps, without tables: describe lists each step's reads and
# writes, and `morca register` refuses a pipeline that would close a cycle
# across pipelines (tests/datasets/: first reads what third writes, second
# what first writes, third what second writes), but not one that reads
# and writes one dataset. A rerun of a done key (`morca backfill --rerun`,
# `morca rerun`) of a pipeline whose steps append is refused without
# --allow-append; one whose steps replace (replacer's `replaces=`) isn't.
# Needs MORCA_DATABASE_URL (pixi run test-datasets starts a throwaway
# server) and jq.
