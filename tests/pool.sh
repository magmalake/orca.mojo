# The ec2 runner's warm pool (morca.ec2, morca.pool, MORCA_EC2_POOL_SECONDS),
# against the stand-in EC2 API (tests/fake_ec2.py), where each instance is a
# local process running its user data. With the scheduler running:
#
# - three runs of fanout, one after another, all run on the first run's head
#   and 2 workers, launched once; each run's worker logs hold its own tasks
#   only, and each instance's samples are under each run;
# - /api/fleet and /ops/pools show the idle instances as "idle (pooled)", with their idle
#   time;
# - a toy run beside them gets an instance of its own (another pipeline);
# - the idle instances shut down after MORCA_EC2_POOL_SECONDS;
# - a new registration (--worker-procs 2) doesn't reuse them; with 2 worker
#   processes per instance, a run on 1 worker, then one on 3 takes the
#   pooled head and worker and launches 2 more; then a run on 1 leaves the
#   other 2 pooled until they shut down;
# - idle workers killed before a run are passed over for new ones;
# - two toy runs starting at once (max_runs=2) don't share the one pooled
#   head;
# - a pooled head handed a run that doesn't take it up (stopped) is
#   replaced by a new one, and the run succeeds;
# - with MORCA_EC2_POOL_SECONDS=0 each run gets instances of its own, which
#   shut themselves down, as before (tests/ec2.sh is all of that).
#
# Needs MORCA_DATABASE_URL (pixi run test-pool starts a throwaway server),
# python3, curl and jq.
