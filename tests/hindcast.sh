# Hindcast (examples/hindcast, #392): GFS 2 m temperature forecasts fetched
# and decoded by a Rust worker, then scored by a Mojo step, over a local
# warehouse and the committed fixtures (offline; nothing is fetched):
#
# - cargo test: the .idx lookup, and the fixtures decode to the 1° grid
#   with the values ecCodes gives;
# - the library exports the four morca_worker_* functions, std linked in;
# - cycles run one per run in either order (as a backfill's runs may) end
#   with the same scores: the forecast of 2026-11-12 +24h is scored against
#   2026-11-13's analysis whichever came first;
# - the grid-wide bias, MAE and RMSE (cos-latitude weighted) and the city
#   scorecard match the numbers examples/hindcast/tools/skill_ref.py gets
#   from ecCodes and numpy;
# - a cycle whose analyses aren't fetched yet is reported as incomplete;
# - a rerun replaces a cycle's rows and its scores, leaving one copy;
# - a cycle that isn't in the bucket defers when it's recent, and fails
#   when it's old.
#
# Run in the rust environment (pixi run -e rust test-hindcast).
