# Rust workers (docs/rust-workers.md, #392): the morca-worker crate's tests,
# then examples/rust-worker, a Rust worker and its Mojo proxy pipeline, over
# a local warehouse:
#
# - cargo test: the crate's ABI and schema rule, and the example's check of
#   its schema against schemas/numbers.json;
# - the library exports the four morca_worker_* functions and nothing else,
#   with Rust's standard library linked in;
# - a run writes the worker's rows in one commit, with its log lines;
# - a panic in the stream, and a schema that doesn't fit the table, fail
#   the attempt, naming the panic or the column, and commit nothing;
# - the stop flag ends the worker's stream early, and what came is
#   committed;
# - an error in the stream reaches the log in the worker's words;
# - Parquet files the worker writes itself are checked, uploaded and
#   committed in one snapshot; a file whose column doesn't fit, one holding
#   two partitions, and one reported but not there fail the attempt and
#   commit nothing; a worker may stream and write files in one run;
# - a run whose process dies after the commit is resumed, streamed or in
#   files: the retry finds the commit, the worker doesn't run again, and
#   the table has one snapshot of the run;
# - each call's output directory is gone after it.
#
# Run in the rust environment (pixi run -e rust test-rust-worker), which has
# cargo and the data environment's tins.
