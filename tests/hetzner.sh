# deploy/hetzner's deploys and rollbacks, against a fake server: ssh,
# hcloud and docker are tests/hetzner's fakes, and morca-stack runs here in
# its trial mode (MORCA_STACK_TEST=1) on directories of its own.
#
# - each apply that changes a tag keeps the tags before it (morca-stack tags
#   --previous, MORCA_PREV_TAG), including on a stack applied before it kept
#   them; applying the same tags again keeps the earlier ones;
# - deploy.sh backs up before it applies, says the previous and the new tag
#   and where the backup is, and stops before applying (unpausing what it
#   paused) when the backup fails, unless --no-backup;
# - deploy.sh --rollback (morca-stack rollback) applies the tags before
#   again, an app that followed the morca tag following it again, registers
#   the pipelines, and refuses with runs running unless --force; a second
#   rollback goes forward again;
# - a deploy registers the pipelines after the apply and before it unpauses,
#   and leaves them paused when that fails;
# - each backup writes <time>.paused beside the dump: the pipelines paused
#   by hand (manual1) and the ones the deploy paused (toy); list-backups
#   says which dumps have one, and a restore unpauses only the ones the
#   deploy paused (a dump without one leaves them all paused);
# - apply starts again only the containers whose spec (image, env file,
#   flags, CGROUPS) changed, and says why; it refuses over running runs
#   only when the scheduler would be replaced; --only and --all; plan
#   changes nothing; Postgres is started once and never again;
# - run cgroups are on by default (#239): CGROUPS=0 drops the scheduler's
#   cgroup flags, a host without cgroup v2 or its memory controller runs it
#   without them, saying so, a failed remount doesn't stop the scheduler,
#   and with them on, apply warns for each pipeline whose peak is over its
#   memory_gb's maximum or what the host can grant;
# - deploy.sh (and --rollback) first brings the server's settings in line
#   with hetzner.env: a key added there reaches settings.env, one emptied is
#   removed, a secret file is rewritten (mode 600), a stack setting set,
#   each named and never its value; the plan then replaces the containers
#   whose env file changed and quiesces for the scheduler; the tags stay;
#   a dry run writes nothing;
# - deploy.sh pauses, waits and registers only when the plan replaces the
#   scheduler: a console-only deploy backs up and replaces the console and
#   nothing else, a deploy of what runs does nothing; an app-only rollback
#   goes on over running runs and registers nothing;
# - the UI and the apps are replaced without downtime: the new one starts as
#   NAME-next, is probed until healthy (the UI's /healthz, its worker
#   listener if MORCA_WORKER_ADDR is set, an app's check path), only then
#   gets the alias NAME and is probed again, and only then is the old one
#   stopped, removed and the new one renamed; a new one that isn't healthy (or exits) is removed and the
#   old one kept, apply goes on with the others and exits non-zero, and an
#   apply again replaces only it; deploy.sh still registers a scheduler it
#   replaced when the UI's replacement fails, then unpauses what it paused
#   and fails naming the UI (a rollback too); a scheduler that fails to
#   start leaves the pipelines paused;
# - quiesce, apply's refusal and status count only the runs the scheduler
#   holds: runs on remote workers aren't waited for, and are listed as left
#   running on the workers (quiesce --workers, rescale.sh's, waits for them);
# - with OVERLAP=1 and can-overlap saying yes, a deploy that replaces the
#   scheduler pauses nothing: the new scheduler starts beside the old one,
#   the old one is set not to restart and renamed scheduler-old-<time>, the
#   new one leads and registers, then the old one is asked to drain and the
#   deploy returns without waiting for its runs (#397): check and status
#   say it's draining N run(s), as information, and a reaper removes it
#   once it exits. A second deploy while one drains overlaps again, its old
#   scheduler under a name of its own beside the first; drain-old
#   --timeout waits and stops one after it; can-overlap says no with
#   OVERLAP off, and the deploy that turns OVERLAP on pauses and waits as
#   before; an old scheduler or scheduler-next that isn't running (a
#   scheduler-old from before #397 too) is removed by the next apply,
#   saying so, and a deploy overlaps over it;
# - a stack's overlay (CONFIG_OVERLAY_FILE, #332) is sent beside
#   settings.env, which names it, checked by the image's morca before
#   anything changes (an image whose morca doesn't read overlays refused),
#   mounted in the scheduler only, whose replacement a change to it causes,
#   and removed when hetzner.env drops it;
# - an app's env file is what its [apps.NAME] in its image's morca.toml
#   asks for (#331): its env, the lake with lake = true, each secret from
#   secrets/orca/<id> (SECRETS_FILE may have any such key; never printed),
#   its port, check and memory; one missing secret, or APPS giving another
#   port, stops the deploy at the plan; an app not declared, or an image
#   without `morca config apps`, gets the fixed env of before;
# - package.sh's release tarball unpacks to morca-hetzner-<version>/ with
#   every script, server/ and the example settings, and its up.sh and
#   deploy.sh run from there (hetzner.env next to them), printing the
#   version and sending the tarball's own server files;
# - a shared hetzner.env (a secrets repository's) names its files relative
#   to its folder, and a laptop's <NAME>.local.env (or HETZNER_LOCAL_ENV)
#   is read after it, its relative names from its own folder; the first
#   line names both; a missing HETZNER_LOCAL_ENV, or one that sets NAME,
#   is refused;
# - morca-stack check: ok on a healthy stack, and FAIL naming what's wrong (a
#   stopped container, an unhealthy UI, a scheduler-next left (a draining
#   old scheduler is information, and an exited one apply removes), a pipeline
#   whose binary isn't in the image, none registered, a canary run that
#   failed or didn't end in time); checked keeps the result, kind and tags;
#   deploy.sh ends with it (hetzner.env's CANARY as --canary) and fails
#   when it fails;
# - promote.sh deploys the tags the dev stack checked, with the flags
#   given, and refuses when its last check failed, was of other tags, or
#   when --from is the target's own settings.
