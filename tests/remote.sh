# The `orca` command against `orca ui` over HTTP, as a logged-in user
# (orca.remote, orca.tokens), over examples/toy.mojo:
#
# - reads (`status`) need no login; actions do, and `orca login` with a
#   wrong password stores nothing; with the right one it stores a token,
#   mode 600 in a directory of mode 700, which the database keeps only as
#   its SHA-256 and the UI's log never shows;
# - backfill (and its preview), pause, unpause, cancel, start, resume and
#   rerun go through the UI: the runs and the pipeline change as the local
#   commands change them, with the same output, and each is a row of
#   orca.audit with the user and source `cli`;
# - an unknown, malformed, expired or revoked token gets 401 and changes
#   nothing, a cookie alongside it included; a token's POST from another
#   site's page is refused; a login for a token has to be JSON;
# - `orca logout` revokes the token, as `orca user revoke` and a new
#   password do; 5 failed logins for a name get 429, as on /login;
# - plain http to anywhere but this machine is refused before connecting.
#
# Needs ORCA_DATABASE_URL (pixi run test-remote starts a throwaway server),
# curl and jq.
