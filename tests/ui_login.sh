# Login to orca ui's actions (orca.auth), over HTTP only, as tests/actions.sh
# is. With no user and no ORCA_UI_LOGIN, actions are open, as before. Once a
# user exists:
#
# - an action without a session gets 401 (JSON) or the login page (HTML),
#   and changes nothing; pages still read without one;
# - a wrong password gets 401 and no cookie; the right one a session cookie
#   that's HttpOnly and SameSite=Strict, and a `next` off the site is
#   ignored;
# - with the cookie the action is done and recorded as the user's, which the
#   run's page shows;
# - logging out, an expired session, a removed user and a changed password
#   all end the session; a login posted from another site is refused;
# - behind a TLS proxy (ORCA_UI_TRUST_PROXY=1, X-Forwarded-Proto) or with
#   ORCA_UI_SECURE_COOKIES=1, an https Origin is the UI's own;
# - 5 failed logins for a name in 15 minutes get 429, the right password
#   included, until the window passes;
# - /healthz answers 200 "ok" without a login, login required or not.
#
# Needs ORCA_DATABASE_URL (pixi run test-ui-login starts a throwaway server),
# curl and jq.
