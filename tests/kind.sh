# orca on a kind cluster (deploy/), each run on a cluster of its own
# (orca.kube). Builds the image, loads it, applies the manifests, and with
# the scheduler's clock fixed just after a fire:
#
# - the toy, registered from the image, is fired, runs as a driver Job and
#   succeeds, orca ui shows it, and nothing labelled with it is left;
# - fanout's runs get a head and 3 workers each, and the tasks of a run
#   reach all 3;
# - a fanout driver pod deleted mid-run is resumed on a new cluster (start
#   2) and succeeds, and the first cluster is gone;
# - with ORCA_VCPU_BUDGET room for one fanout cluster, a toy run queued
#   beside two fanout runs never runs at the same time as either;
# - a pod a killed scheduler left behind is deleted when it starts again.
#
# KEEP_CLUSTER=1 leaves a cluster this made; KIND_CLUSTER names one to use.
# Needs docker, kind, kubectl, curl and jq.
