# A scratch morca project, for CI to call morca's reusable project workflows
# on (.github/workflows/project-image.yml and project-test.yml, from ci.yml's
# project-* jobs) as a project's own CI would:
#
#     sh tests/example-project.sh build/example-project
#
# It adds this commit of morca-mojo as `pixi shelf add` pins it, by revision,
# which must be on GitHub (CI's commit; MORCA_REV and MORCA_REPO say another).
# Its one pipeline is examples/toy.mojo, its morca.toml configures it, and its
# `test` task builds the toy and runs a partition. Needs pixi, for the lock.
