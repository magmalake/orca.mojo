"""The Lean model of a retried step (formal/) against `morca.tables.append`:
every sequence of up to five events in formal/difftest/retry.cases is
replayed over a local Iceberg table of its own, and the snapshots the table
then holds are compared with the ones the model's oracle printed
(formal/Oracle/Main.lean; the `formal` CI job checks the file is its output).

Events, one letter each:
- `c`: the attempt makes its next commit (`append`);
- `x`: the worker crashes: the next attempt starts with a new `Ctx`, which
  has made no commits;
- `o`: the same step commits for another partition.

A crash in the middle of an `append` isn't replayed as such: to the table it
is `x` (the commit didn't happen) or `c` then `x` (it did). Run in the data
environment, from the repository's root.
