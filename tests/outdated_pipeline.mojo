"""A long run that polls, for tests/outdated.sh (#397): its one step loops,
a unit of work every 0.2 s, and appends to OUTDATED_OUT each time what
`morca.outdated()` says changes, with `code_version()`,
`desired_code_version()` and `outdated_why()`.

For a month in OUTDATED_HANDOVER it returns once it's outdated, as a
pipeline that hands over does; for the others it ignores it, the default,
and returns only once the file OUTDATED_STOP/<month> exists.
