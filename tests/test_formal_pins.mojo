"""The Lean model of pinned reads (formal/Orca/Pins) against `Ctx.pin` over a
store: every sequence of up to five events in formal/difftest/pins.cases is
replayed in a run of its own, and the answers `Ctx.pin` gave are compared
with the ones the model's oracle printed (formal/Oracle/Pins.lean; the
`formal` CI job checks the file is its output). On `MemoryStore` for every
sequence, and on `SqliteStore` for those of up to four events.

Events, one letter each, over two tables, each at snapshot 1 to begin with:
- `a`, `b`: the attempt reads the table (`Ctx.pin` with its current
  snapshot);
- `A`, `B`: another writer commits to the table: its current snapshot is the
  next number;
- `x`: the worker crashes: the next attempt starts, with the store's
  `pinned_reads` and a new `Ctx`.

Run from the repository's root.
