"""The pipeline of tests/grants.sh: one step that writes what its run was
granted (morca.resources) to a file, then takes a while, so the test can see
which runs overlap.

One pipeline per name: `run["wide"]()` runs the pipeline `wide`, which
scripts/pipelines.sh's binary does as `build/wide`; built on its own, `-D
GRANTEE=wide` makes `main` that one. For a month, the step writes
`$GRANTEE_OUT/<name>-<month>.env` with the run's
`MORCA_GRANT_CPUS`, `MORCA_GRANT_MEMORY_MB` and `DISTA_WORKER_SLOTS` (each
`-` when unset), and `GRANTEE_PARALLEL` as `morca.auto_count` reads it at
2 GB each, then sleeps `GRANTEE_SLEEP` (2) seconds.
