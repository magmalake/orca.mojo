# Stopping morca ui (morca.web.drain), as `docker stop` does when a deploy
# retires the old UI:
#
# - SIGTERM with a slow request in flight (its query waits on a lock this
#   test holds): new connections are refused at once, /healthz on a
#   connection kept alive from before answers 503 `draining`, the slow
#   request still gets its 200, and morca ui exits 0 soon after, well within
#   MORCA_UI_DRAIN_SECONDS;
# - SIGTERM with nothing in flight: it exits 0 at once;
# - SIGINT with a request that outlasts MORCA_UI_DRAIN_SECONDS: it exits
#   (1, the request cut) within the bound plus half a second.
#
# Needs MORCA_DATABASE_URL (pixi run test-ui-drain starts a throwaway server),
# curl, and bash (its /dev/tcp holds the kept-alive connection).
