"""The Lean model of fencing (formal/Morca/Fence) against `PgStore`: every
sequence of up to four events in formal/difftest/fence.cases is replayed on
a run of its own, and which claims and fence checks passed is compared with
what the model's oracle printed (formal/Oracle/Fence.lean; the `formal` CI
job checks the file is its output).

Two processes, `p:1` and `q:2`, and a run that `p:1` has just created; the
stale limit is 1000 s. Events, one letter each:
- `P`, `Q`: the process claims the run (`claim`);
- `p`, `q`: the process checks its fence (`fence`, what `Ctx.fence` calls
  before each commit);
- `b`, `c`: the process's heartbeat beats (`beat_run`);
- `t`, `T`: 300 s, 600 s pass: the run's heartbeat is moved that far back,
  which is the same to every comparison with `now()`.

An outcome is `o` (the claim or the check passes), `x` (it is refused) or
`-` (a beat, or time). The seconds the test itself takes are far from any
limit: the nearest is 100 s away. Run under scripts/with-postgres.sh, from
the repository's root.
