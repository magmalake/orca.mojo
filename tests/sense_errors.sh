# A sensor whose datasets hold something it can't run doesn't stop
# (tests/fake_sensor stands in for its binary, so no warehouse is needed):
#
# - a snapshot whose orca.partitions isn't a partition key (a week) is
#   recorded as seen with no run and why, and a snapshot of another dataset
#   seen in the same tick still starts its run;
# - the next ticks start nothing more, and say nothing more of it;
# - a sense that fails is kept as the pipeline's sense_error, printed once
#   however many ticks see it, shown by orca ui, and cleared once sensing
#   works again.
#
# Needs ORCA_DATABASE_URL (pixi run test-sense-errors starts a throwaway
# server), curl and jq.
