#!/bin/sh
# Pipeline priority and the order of a pass (#421), on the local runner
# against a host with room for one run of 2 GB (MORCA_HOST_MEMORY_MB, no
# reserve), each pass one `morca tick`. Over tests/grants/grantee.mojo built
# as alpha, bravo and zulu, and examples/daily.mojo:
#
# - `priority` is checked by `config check` (an integer), recorded by
#   register, shown by `config show` with its source, laid over by an
#   overlay, written by `config export`, and on the pipeline's page;
# - the higher priority starts first whatever the names, and the run that
#   waits names the pipeline holding the room; equal priorities go by name;
# - a scheduled run starts before a fill run, though the fill pipeline's
#   name sorts first;
# - a due retry starts before a newer queued run of its pipeline.
#
# Needs MORCA_DATABASE_URL (pixi run test-priority starts a throwaway
# server), curl, jq and python3.
