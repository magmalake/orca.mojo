# The image `morca aws push` builds for a project that added morca with
# `pixi shelf add morca-mojo`, on morca's runtime image,
# ghcr.io/morca-dev/morca-runtime:<MORCA_VERSION> (deploy/runtime.Dockerfile).
# The runtime has morca's own `morca` and `morca_maintain`, git, libcurl, the CA
# bundles, llvm-symbolizer and the /opt/morca layout and environment; this
# adds only the project's programs:
#
# - its apps, every bin/*.mojo, at /opt/morca/bin/<name> (`morca aws app` runs
#   them). bin/scheduler.mojo, the two lines calling morca.command, becomes
#   /opt/morca/bin/morca in place of the runtime's, and bin/morca_maintain.mojo
#   /opt/morca/bin/morca_maintain; a project without them runs the runtime's.
# - its pipelines, every pipelines/*.mojo, at /opt/morca/pipelines/<name>,
#   with the source map `morca locate` writes beside each.
# - the pixi environment's libraries those link or dlopen, in /opt/morca/lib
#   over the runtime's, so the project's own versions win.
#
# `src/` is on the import path if the project has one. A project with a
# Dockerfile.morca of its own builds that instead, and can start it the same
# way: `ARG MORCA_VERSION` and `FROM ghcr.io/morca-dev/morca-runtime:${MORCA_VERSION}`.
#
# MORCA_VERSION is the morca-mojo the project pins, which `morca aws push`
# reads from pixi.lock; the runtime and the project's pipelines are then the
# same morca. By hand:
#
#     docker build -f project.Dockerfile --build-arg MORCA_VERSION=0.24.0 \
#         -t ghcr.io/<owner>/<project>:<version> .
#
# Name the image after the project (ghcr.io/morca-dev/census, not
# ghcr.io/morca-dev/morca), and set MORCA_IMAGE in deploy/hetzner's
# hetzner.env to it. MORCA_RUNTIME names another runtime repository, such as
# one built locally (`docker build -f deploy/runtime.Dockerfile -t
# morca-runtime:0.24.0 .` in morca, then --build-arg MORCA_RUNTIME=morca-runtime).
#
# MORCA_SOURCE and MORCA_COMMIT say what the pipelines were built from, which
# each run records and morca ui links. They're set in the image's environment,
# not compiled in.
#
# Everything is built with line tables (-g1) and the image has
# llvm-symbolizer, so a crash's stack dump in a run's driver.log names each
# frame's function, file and line (morca.crash). The line tables, compressed,
# make a binary about half as big again (mojo-census's gharchive: 4.2 MB,
# 6.5 MB with them, 25 MB uncompressed) and leave its speed as it was.
#
# The binaries are built for MOJO_TARGET_CPU, not for the CPU of the machine
# building them (`mojo build` defaults to that). GitHub's arm64 runners are
# Neoverse N2, which has SVE2; Hetzner's CAX servers are Neoverse N1, which
# has not, so a binary built there dies on the server with SIGILL (exit
# 132). N1 code runs on N2, V1, V2 and Graviton. Build for something else
# with --build-arg MOJO_TARGET_CPU=<cpu> (x86-64-v3 for linux/amd64).
# No default version: the error for a build without one names what's missing.
