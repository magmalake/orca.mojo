#
# Code changes: pulls the images at the tags and starts again the containers
# whose image or settings changed (the scheduler, ui, sampler, apps and
# tunnel; the others keep running), as `morca aws app` and `morca aws up` did
# on AWS. The morca tag also becomes the default for the apps; an
# <app>=<tag> argument gives one app another. Postgres is not restarted.
# --all starts every container again, changed or not.
#
# Before anything changes on the server it checks hetzner.env: DRAIN_SECONDS
# is required (#390), a whole number of seconds above 0, how long an old
# scheduler may keep draining its runs after an overlapping deploy before it
# is stopped (docs/hetzner.md#the-drain-limit). Without it, or with 0 or a
# negative value, the deploy stops there, saying to set it.
#
# Then it brings the server's settings in line with hetzner.env, as up.sh
# writes them (sync_settings in lib.sh): settings.env, the secret files,
# the stack settings (OVERLAP, DRAIN_SECONDS, BACKUP_KEEP...) and the apps; not the tags, which are this script's.
# It prints what changed, settings.env's keys by name (added, removed,
# changed), never a value; a stack setting old -> new. A container whose
# env file this changes is then replaced ("replace settings: ..." in the
# plan), the scheduler's included, which quiesces as below. --rollback
# does it too: it rolls the tags back, not the settings, which are
# hetzner.env's (to undo a setting, change it there).
#
# It first asks the server what the apply would replace (morca-stack plan,
# one line per container) and goes on from that:
#
# - The scheduler is replaced (a new morca tag, or its settings changed):
#   restarting it kills running runs, so it quiesces first: pauses every
#   pipeline that isn't paused, waits for the running runs to end (up to
#   --timeout, default 3600 s), deploys, registers the pipelines from the
#   new image (morca-stack register) and unpauses the pipelines it paused.
#   Pipelines that were already paused (by hand or by the watchdog) stay
#   paused. On a timeout, a failed deploy or a failed registration the
#   pipelines stay paused, and the message says how to undo it. --force
#   skips the pause and kills the running runs. Only this path waits for
#   runs: it's taken when the schedulers can't overlap (OVERLAP=0 in
#   hetzner.env, a migration that raises the floor past the old binary, an
#   old scheduler without overlap, a rollback), and then the old
#   scheduler's restart would kill them (docs/overlap.md).
# - The scheduler is replaced and the stack overlaps schedulers (the
#   default; OVERLAP=0 in hetzner.env turns it off, docs/overlap.md), and
#   morca-stack can-overlap says the new image's scheduler may start beside
#   the old one (no migration of it raises the floor past the old binary):
#   nothing is paused and runs go on. The apply starts the new scheduler beside the old one and waits
#   until it leads; it registers the pipelines from the new image, asks the
#   old scheduler to drain (morca-stack drain-old) and returns: it doesn't
#   wait for the old scheduler's runs. They see that they're outdated
#   (morca.outdated()) and end when their code decides, or are killed once
#   DRAIN_SECONDS have passed (and queued again by the new scheduler); the
#   old scheduler then exits and is removed. Another deploy
#   meanwhile overlaps again, each old scheduler draining under its own
#   name (docs/overlap.md). A rollback, --force and a dry run don't overlap.
# - The scheduler keeps running (an app's tag only, say the census
#   console's): nothing is paused and runs go on; it backs up and applies,
#   and nothing needs registering (the pipelines are in the scheduler's
#   image, which didn't change).
# - Nothing is replaced: no backup, and the apply keeps every container.
#
# The UI and the apps are replaced without downtime (morca-stack starts the
# new one beside the old and waits until it's healthy). One that never is
# fails the deploy after the rest is applied, the old one still serving: a
# scheduler it replaced is registered first, the pipelines it paused are
# unpaused (the scheduler is deployed: nothing waits on the UI), and it
# exits non-zero naming what wasn't replaced; morca-stack apply on the
# server tries those again. The pipelines stay paused only when the
# scheduler itself, the registration or the backup failed.
#
# The quiesce waits only for the runs the scheduler's own processes hold: a
# run on a remote worker (placement worker:<pool>) goes on through the
# scheduler's restart, and is listed as left running on the workers.
#
# Before it applies anything that replaces a container it backs the
# database up (morca-stack backup-now, to s3://BUCKET/backups/pg/<time>.dump,
# with <time>.paused beside it: the pipelines paused by hand and the ones
# this deploy paused, so a restore of the dump unpauses only the latter) and
# stops if that fails, unless --no-backup. The server keeps the tags it ran
# before (morca-stack tags --previous); --rollback applies those again, the
# same way (docs/hetzner.md#rolling-back).
#
# When the morca tag changes (not for a rollback), the release's upgrade steps
# (docs/hetzner.md#a-releases-upgrade-steps, the new image's upgrade.toml):
# the "before" ones are listed first, before anything changes, and each must
# be done (a command run, an instruction confirmed: asked for, or named in
# --confirmed id,...; with --yes an unconfirmed instruction stops the deploy);
# the "after" ones run once the pipelines are registered, before they're
# unpaused (commands asked about, or run with --yes; instructions printed),
# and a failed one fails the deploy at the end, the rest deployed.
#
# It ends with morca-stack check (docs/hetzner.md#the-check-after-each-deploy):
# the containers, one scheduler, the pipelines' binaries, and a canary run
# for each of hetzner.env's CANARY; when the check fails the deploy fails,
# with nothing undone.
